# motivation

<br/>

> Following a significant *F*-test, the next step is to determine which means differ  

<br/>

--
> If all group means are to be compared, then we should correct for multiple testing

<br/>

--

> That is, conducting many tests increases the probability of finding one that is significant, even if it is not

#### The least significant difference test is based on the two-sample *t*-statistic

$$\large t = \frac{\bar{y}_1 - \bar{y}_2}{SEDM}$$
--

#### Fisher said that 2 means ( $\bar{y}_i$ and $\bar{y}_j$ ) are different if:

$$\large |\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j| \geq t_{1-\alpha/2,a(n-1)}\sqrt{\frac{2MSW}{n}}$$

<br/>

where MSW (aka MSE) comes from the ANOVA table

## PAIRWISE *t*-TEST

<br/>

### One can always fall back on pairwise, two-sample *t*-tests, but you should adjust the p values

<br/>

--
### Bonferroni adjustment

- Multiply each *p*-value by the number of tests  

- If this results in *p* > 1, set *p* to 1

#### According to Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test, two means ( $\bar{y}_i$ and $\bar{y}_j$) are different if:

$$\large |\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}_j | \geq  q_{1- \alpha,a,a(n-1)}\sqrt{\frac{MSW}{n}}$$

<br/>

where $q$ comes from the "Studentized Range Distribution"(see `qtukey` in `R`). MSW comes from the ANOVA table

#### Fisher's LSD test

- $\large t_{1-\alpha/2,a(n-1)} = t_{0.975,9} = 2.26$  

--

- LSD = $\large t_{1-\alpha/2;a(n-1)}\sqrt{2MSW/n} = 2.32$  

--

#### Tukey's HSD test

- $\large q_{1-\alpha,a,a(n-1)} = q_{0.95,3,9} = 3.95$  

--

- HSD = $\large q_{1-\alpha,a,a(n-1)}\sqrt{MSW/n} = 2.86$  

<br/>
--
Note that it's more difficult to observe a difference between group means with the more conservative Tukey test

---
# summary

--
- Only do multiple comparison tests after a significant *F*-test  

--
- The motivation is that if you do 100 tests, 5 (on average) will be significant even if there is no difference  

--
- From least conservative to most conservative, the order is: Fisher's LSD, Tukey's HSD, and then pairwise *t*-tests with Bonferroni adjustments  

--
- There are many other types of multiple comparison tests other than the 3 we covered  

--
- Tukey's HSD test is probably the method of choice these days. However,

  + It is so conservative that sometimes you won't see any pairwise differences even after a significant *F*-test
