# arcsine-square root transformation

<br/>

$$\huge y = arcsin(\sqrt{u})$$

<br/>

--

- Used on proportions  

--

- logit transformation is an alternative: $y = log\Big(\frac{u}{1-u}\Big)$  

--

- Binomial (logistic) regression is an alternative for proportions

---
# reciprocal transformation

<br/>

$$\huge y = \frac{1}{u + C}$$

<br/>

--

- C is often 1 but could be 0 if there are no zeros in $u$  

--

- Useful when group SDs are proportional to the squared group means
