# Linear model review

Remember from lecture that a linear model is an equation of the form:

$$\large y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2} + . . . + \beta_px_{ip} + \epsilon_i$$

where the $\beta$â€™s are coefficients, and the $x$ values are predictor variables (or dummy variables for categorical predictors).

This equation is often expressed in matrix notation as:

$$\large y = \mathbf{X\beta} + \epsilon$$

where $X$ is a design matrix and $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients.

# The Island Scrub Jay (*Aphelocoma insularis*)


```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="70%", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Aphelocoma_insularis_Bouton_2.jpg")
```

For this lab, we'll use the Island Scrub Jay data from lecture:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(FANR6750)

# Survey location/predictor data
data("cruzData")
head(cruzData)

# Jay counts
data("jayData")
head(jayData)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(FANR6750)
data("jayData")
data("cruzData")
kable(head(cruzData))
kable(head(jayData))
```

The `cruzData` object has one row for each of the 2787 grid cell covering the island. The `jayData` object has counts of jays and habitat predictors for 100 (fake) survey locations.

## Maps in `R`

Although we do not have time to fully cover it in this course, `R` has an excellent GIS and mapping capabilities. We can analyze spatial data make nice maps using a number of packages, including `raster` and `sf`. For example, we can convert the jay data to a *simple features* (`sf`) spatial object, which `ggplot2` knows how to use for maps:

```{r}
# Set CRS
projcrs <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"

# Covert data frame to sf data frame
cruz_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(x = cruzData, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = projcrs)

# Map elevation
ggplot(cruz_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = elevation), shape = 15, size = 2)
```

Or forest cover:

```{r}
ggplot(cruz_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = forest), shape = 15, size = 2)
```

Or chaparral with the survey locations:

```{r}
jay_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(x = jayData, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = projcrs)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = cruz_sf, aes(color = chaparral), shape = 15, size = 2) +
  geom_sf(data = jay_sf, color = "red")
```

## Fit some models 

### Simple linear regression

```{r}
fm1 <- lm(jays ~ elevation, data = jayData)
summary(fm1)
```

### Linear regression with quadratic effects

```{r}
fm2 <- lm(jays ~ elevation + I(elevation^2), data = jayData)
summary(fm2)
```

***

What is the quadratic effect measuring? How do we interpret the coefficients from this model?

***

### Multiple linear regression

```{r}
fm3 <- lm(jays ~ elevation + chaparral, data = jayData)
summary(fm3)
```

***

How do we interpret the elevation and chaparral parameters in this model?

***

### One-way ANOVA

```{r}
fm4 <- lm(jays ~ habitat, data = jayData)
summary(fm4)
```

### ANCOVA

```{r}
fm5 <- lm(jays ~ habitat + elevation, data = jayData)
summary(fm5)
```

### One factor and continuous covariates with quadratic effects

```{r}
fm6 <- lm(jays ~ habitat + elevation + I(elevation^2) + chaparral, data = jayData)
summary(fm6)
```

***

Now things are getting pretty complicated. Be sure you can explain, in plain English, what each parameter represents

***

Let's also take a moment to make some visualizations. For example, understanding quadratic effects is often easiest by visualizing predicted values:

First, create a sequence of values of elevation, holding other predictors constant

```{r}
nd1 <- data.frame(habitat = "Oak", elevation = seq(min(jayData$elev), 
                                                   max(jayData$elev), length=100),
                  chaparral=mean(jayData$chaparral))
```

Next, obtain the predictions from the fitted model:

```{r}
E6.elev <- predict(fm6, newdata = nd1, 
                   type = "response", 
                   se.fit = TRUE, 
                   interval = "confidence")
E6.elev <- cbind(E6.elev$fit, nd1)
head(E6.elev)
```

And finally, make the plot:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = jayData, aes(x = elevation, y = jays)) +
  geom_path(data = E6.elev, aes(x = elevation, y = fit)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = E6.elev, aes(x = elevation, ymin = lwr, ymax = upr),
              fill = NA, color = "black", linetype = "longdash") +
  scale_x_continuous("Elevation") +
  scale_y_continuous("Number of Jays")
```

We can also predict the number of jays at each point on the entire island:

```{r}
E6 <- predict(fm6, type = "response", 
              newdata = cruzData, 
              interval = "confidence")
E6 <- cbind(cruzData[,c("x","y")], E6)

E6_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(x = E6, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = projcrs)

ggplot(E6_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = fit), shape = 15, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(30, 55)) +
  labs(title = "Expected number of Jays")

```

Although not often included in papers, it's also important to show uncertainy in these predictions:

```{r}
ggplot(E6_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = lwr), shape = 15, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(30, 55)) +
  labs(title = "Lower CI")
```


```{r}
ggplot(E6_sf) +
  geom_sf(aes(color = upr), shape = 15, size = 2) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(limits = c(30, 55)) +
  labs(title = "Upper CI")
```


#### Another way to obtain the predictions

We could also obtain the predictions as follows:

```{r}
X <- model.matrix(~habitat + elevation + I(elevation^2) + chaparral, data = cruzData)
beta <- coef(fm6) # beta estimates
E <- X %*% beta # expected number of jays at each pixel
head(E, n=4)
```

The `predict()` function may often be a little easier but understanding how to do obtain the predictions "by hand" like this is a good check on whether you understand 1) the design matrix, and 2) the relationship between the design matrix, model parameters, and predicted values.

# Assignment: Species Richness in Switzerland

Birds are sampled at 267 locations (quadrats) as part of the Swiss breeding bird survey

The following predictor variables are available: elevation, percent cover of forest, and the presence of water

The country-wide data can be loaded using:

```{r}
library(FANR6750)
data("switzerland")
```

The survey data can be loaded using:

```{r}
data("swissData")
```

Create an R markdown report to do the following:

1) Fit 4 models of species richness using `lm()`. At least one model should include an interaction, and one model should include quadratic effects

2) Interpret, in plain English, the $\beta$ parameter estimates for each model.

3) Create the design matrix for one of the models, and (matrix) multiply it by the $\beta$ coefficients to compute the expected number of species at each plot

4) Use `predict()` to plot the relationship between expected species richness and the predictor variable with the quadratic effects. Include 95% CI in your plot.

5) Using the model with the interaction, predict species richness at each location in Switzerland. Include a map of the predicted values (you may use whatever graphing package you like to make the map but it must be made in `R` and your code must be included).

You may format the report however you like but it should be well-organized, with relevant headers, plain text, and the elements described above.
